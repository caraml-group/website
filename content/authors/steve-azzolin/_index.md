Hello :) I'm a MSc student of Artificial Intelligence Systems at the University of Trento in Italy. Currently, I'm a visiting research student at the University of Cambridge working on Explainability for Graph Neural Networks. I'm truly excited about research and in the long run I would like to explore the application of Machine Learning to the field of Biology. Computer Vision and Reinforcement Learning are also topics I want to keep an eye on.
Do not hesitate to contact me for a chat!
