I am a PhD student in the Computer Laboratory at the University of Cambridge under the supervision of Prof. Mateja Jamnik. My research is on multi-modal machine learning on biomedical data, essentially trying to build dense multi-scale representations of the human biology. I am currently working on applications in computational pathology, spatial transcriptomics, and precision medicine, but am easily excited by a wide range of application domains.
