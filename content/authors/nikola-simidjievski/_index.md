I am currently a postdoc at the Department of Computer Science and Technology, working with Prof. Mateja Jamnik and Prof. Pietro Li√≤. My research interests are at the intersection of machine learning and natural sciences (medicine, biology and neuroscience). More specifically, I am interested in different topics of Bayesian inference and causal inference from multi-modal data and their application in oncology. I have experience in computational scientific discovery, and I am quite keen on machine learning for modelling dynamic systems. More broadly, I am also interested in applications of machine learning for space research.
