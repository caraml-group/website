I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Imeprial College London and also the Imperial-X initiative. I am a visiting researcher at the Department of Computer Science and Technology at the University of Cambridge. 

My research focuses on the intersections between hardware, algorithms, and security in the Machine Learning world. I am generally interested in making Machine Learning systems fast, reliable and efficient.
