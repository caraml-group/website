I am a PhD candidate at the University of Cambridge, where I am focusing on the explainability and interpretability of artificial intelligence, specifically neural networks. I am currently mainly focused on graph neural networks. Prior to this, I studied towards a BSc in Computer Science at the University of St Andrews and an MPhil in Advanced Computer Science at the University of Cambridge.
