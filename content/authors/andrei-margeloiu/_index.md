I am a PhD student in Machine Learning at the University of Cambridge, under the supervision of Mateja Jamnik. My research focuses on data efficient machine learning methods (learning from very small datasets, in the order of 100s of samples). Specifically, I am interested in making probabilistic models more effective on small datasets by learning prior parameter distributions.
