I am a PhD student at the University of Trento working in the <a href="https://mobs-fbk.github.io/">MobS Lab</a> at the ICT center of the Fondazione Bruno Kessler in Trento (IT) under the supervision of Bruno Lepri, and in the <a href="http://sml.disi.unitn.it/">Structured Machine Learning (SML)</a> Group at the University of Trento under the supervision of Andrea Passerini. My research activity focuses on Complex Systems, Temporal Networks and explainable artificial intelligence. My current projects are related to Graph Neural Network Explainability.
I am always enthusiastic to talk about science, feel free to contact me. :)
