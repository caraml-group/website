I am an Affiliated Lecturer in the Department of Computer Science and Technology (Computer Laboratory) at the University of Cambridge. I am also a Departmental Early Career Fellow in the Accelerate Programme for Scientific Discovery. I lead the Computational Morphogenomics Group. Come Spring 2023, I will be an Assistant Professor in the Statistics Department and Irving Cancer Dynamics Institute at Columbia University.  

I am a Computational Biologist and Applied Statistician. I am interested in the emergence of multi-cellularity and in how genomics and mechanics interact to create shape and function in biological development. I work on multi-modal learning and causal representation learning. My current focus is on developing machine learning tools for dynamical systems.
