I am a PhD student jointly supervised by Prof. Florian Markowetz and Prof. Pietro Liò at the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute and the Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Cambridge, funded by Cancer Research UK (CRUK, the “Charity”). 

My research aims to assess the predictive power of ongoing mutational processes as biomarkers compared to extinct historic processes and classical biomarkers under different models.
