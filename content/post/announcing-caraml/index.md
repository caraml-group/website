## What is CaRAML and who can join?

CaRAML - **Cambridge Research & Applications in Machine Learning** - is a community of machine learning and artificial intelligence researchers at the University of Cambridge.
CaRAML aims to bring together Cambridge students, researchers, and faculty working in ML and AI across theory and practice.

CaRAML is primarily a **student-led effort**, and not an official affliliation.
Everyone is welcome to participate regardless of affiliation and experience.

## What are the goals of CaRAML?

### Community
The primary goal of CaRAML is to build a community and bring likeminded people together via **in-person social interactions** and [**events**]({{< relref "/events/" >}}).
Events can range from research focussed meetups and reading groups, to socials at local restaurants and pubs, to activities such as sports or hikes.

### Research Platform
CaRAML also aims to provide a platform for sharing and disseminating research via [**blogposts**]({{< relref "/post/" >}}) and **talks**, as well as highlight members' achievements via an active [**social media**](https://twitter.com/CaRAMLCambridge) presence.

The CaRAML blog can host or link to blogposts written by members about their latest papers, commentaries on recent research advances, and beyond.
The website supports markdown and LaTeX.

### Collaboration Channel
Finally, CaRAML is an active [**Slack channel**](https://caraml-group.slack.com/) where members can collaborate on research projects, discuss papers in reading groups, advertise opportunities, organise social events, and much more.

## How did CaRAML start?

CaRAML was **started in 2020** (and restarted in 2022) by PhD students at the Computer Laboratory and their cross-departmental collaborators, with the goal of promoting AI and ML research happening across Cambridge and building a likeminded community.
